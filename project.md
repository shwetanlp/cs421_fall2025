# Graduate Research Study: NLP Reproducibility Project

## Overview
Graduate students will conduct a research reproducibility and evaluation project focused on replicating results from an existing NLP research paper (ACL/NAACL 2025).  
The project can be done individually or in pairs. Deliverables include a reproducibility report, source code, and a presentation.

## Project Guidelines
- **Research Paper Selection**
  - Choose an ACL/NAACL 2025 NLP paper.
  - Submit details in the provided [Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtquSNFH247aRQMg06BF3eeoyOtgSdFO_kMil1Uls14/edit?usp=sharing) (first-come, first-served).
  - Must follow the [NLP Reproducibility Checklist (Dodge et al., 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.809.pdf).

- **Research Study**
  - Analyze the reproducibility of the selected paper.
  - Work individually or in pairs (pairs must submit a signed contribution statement).
  - Address methodology, implementation, and challenges.
  - Consider computational constraints and document adaptations.
  - Deliver the presentation, source code, and report by their respective deadlines.

- **Recommendations for Limited Compute**
  - Use smaller or open-source alternatives (e.g., Llama 2/3, Flan-T5 base).
  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning encouraged.
  - Free compute resources (Google Colab, Kaggle) may be leveraged.
  - Report must describe compromises and impacts on reproducibility.

## Deadlines & Milestones
- **Paper Selection**: September 22, 2025 (11:59 PM CST)
- **Research Presentation**:  
  - Presentations: TBD
- **Report Submission**: TBD
- **Source Code Submission**: TBD
